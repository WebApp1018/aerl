- Add reset supervisor circuit
	- TPS3808G33QDBVRQ1
	- Cut WDI trace between pad and via (underneath U12)
	- 100K resistor between pin 6 Vdd and pin 4 Ct.
	- Short pin 6 Vdd and pin 5 sense together.
- Short pin 6 and pin 9 together on U11 (TUSB320IRWBR).
	- Fixes INT/ID combined quirk.
- Touch-sense controller (TSC2046) must be removed for Quectel module to work.
	- Reset line is held low/active by the TSC.
	- In future we need to order the Variscite modules without the TSC.
- External ethernet PHY
	- Reset line needs to be pulled down rather than up.
	- This ensures it is held low until the kernel driver initialises the chip.
