# Overview

## Alerts

Alerts represent an event created by a trigger.

### Severity

Every alert has one of three assigned severities. This can be used to conditionally notify receivers depending on the importance of the alert.

- Informational - Expected based on normal conditions.
- Warning - Indicates a possible issue that does not need immediate attention.
- Error - A failure has been detected that may have caused a device to stop functioning.

## Triggers

Triggers define the telemetry event that creates a given alert. This is where the device, metric, threshold and severity is configured.

## Receivers

Receivers are how alerts are routed to users or downstream alert mangement systems.
