# Enroll in Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

In order to enhance the security of your AERL Cloud account, it is recommended to enroll in Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA). Multi-Factor Authentication provides an additional layer of security by requiring not only your password but also a verification code generated by an authenticator app on your device. Follow the steps below to set up MFA:

<Steps>
### Install an authenticator application.
Download and install an authenticator app on your mobile device. Popular choices include Authy, Google Authenticator, or Microsoft Authenticator. You can find these apps in your device's app store.

### Go to the MFA enrollment page.
Open your web browser and navigate to the MFA enrollment page at https://aerl.cloud/auth/mfa/enroll.

### Scan the QR code.
Open the authenticator app you installed on your device. Use it to scan the QR code displayed on the enrollment page. This will automatically add your AERL Cloud account to the app and start generating time-based one-time passwords (OTP).

### Enter your OTP.
After scanning the QR code, your authenticator app will provide you with a one-time password. Enter this OTP in the input box located underneath the QR code on the enrollment page to confirm that you've set up the authenticator correctly.

### Click the "Enroll" button.
Once you've entered the OTP, click the "Enroll" button to complete the MFA enrollment process.

</Steps>

Once these steps are completed, you have successfully enrolled in MFA for your AERL Cloud account. From now on, when you log in, you will need to provide the OTP generated by your authenticator app in addition to your password. This extra step ensures that your account remains secure even if your password is compromised.
